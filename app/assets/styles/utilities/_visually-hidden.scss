/**
 * Makes elements visually invisible but still accessible to screen-readers.
 *
 * This Css has been carefully tested to ensure screen-readers can read and
 * activate (in case of links and buttons) the elements with this class. Please
 * use caution when changing anything, even seemingly safe ones. For example
 * changing width from 1 to 0 would prevent TalkBack from activating (clicking)
 * buttons despite TalkBack reading them just fine. This is because
 * element needs to have a defined size and be on viewport otherwise TalkBack
 * does not allow activation of buttons.
